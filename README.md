# Random Number Generator with Even and Odd Lists

This project is a simple C# application that generates a list of random integers, classifies them into even and odd numbers, and displays all three lists (original, evens, and odds) in the console.

## Functionality

The application uses the `Random` class from the .NET framework to generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 50. These numbers are stored in three separate lists:
- **Original**: Stores all generated numbers.
- **Odds**: Stores only odd numbers.
- **Evens**: Stores only even numbers.

After generating the numbers, the program prints all three lists in a readable format in the console.
